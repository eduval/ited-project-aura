# 📊 Project AURA – Academic Unified Reporting & Automation

Welcome to **Project AURA**, a transformative initiative by **iTED (Ideas to Educate)**.

---

## Project Vision

Build a secure, intelligent, and responsive platform that automates and elevates how we manage academic operations. From automating grade retrieval to generating transcripts, **AURA** streamlines processes that are currently manual, error-prone, and time-consuming.

Through a powerful blend of **Python automation**, **Canvas APIs**, **Firebase authentication**, and **Kibana dashboards**, this project is designed to boost efficiency, transparency, and data-driven interventions.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- **Automate Data Processing:** Retrieve grades, attendance, and assignments from Canvas LMS via its API.
- **Responsive Web App:** Multi-user interface with admin & operator roles, secured by Firebase Auth.
- **Monitor Academic Risks:** Track students with low performance and instructors with delayed grading.
- **Dynamic Document Generation:** Create Word & Excel academic documents using Python.
- **Security Analytics:** Comprehensive logs and dashboards with Kibana, Elasticsearch, and Grafana.
- **Robust Security:** Maintain audit trails, enforce data integrity, and follow best practices.
